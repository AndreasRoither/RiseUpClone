# Install and configure

To use the Universal Render Pipeline (URP), you can either start a new Project or upgrade an existing one. 

The following sub-chapters describe how to:

- [Create a new Project with URP from a template](CreateNewProjectFromTemplate.md). When you do this, Unity automatically creates and assigns a Universal Render Pipeline Asset to your Graphics settings.
- [Install URP into a Project](InstallURPIntoAProject.md). When you do this, you must also create a Universal Render Pipeline Asset and add it to your Graphics settings.


**Note:** Projects you make with Universal Render Pipeline are not compatible with High Definition Render Pipeline or the Built-in Unity render pipeline. The three render pipelines use different underlying technologies for Shaders, lighting models, rendering effects, and more. Before you start development, you must decide which render pipeline to use in your Project.
